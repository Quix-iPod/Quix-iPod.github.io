        <h1>Welcome to my barebones website</h1>
        <h2>I'm Quix (also known as QuixTest)</h2>
        <p> I like to do dumb stuff with iPods, and help archive/document anything I can for the community. I'll continue to add to this website as time goes on.
        <p> I tend to hang out in either the DankPods Discord, or iPodHaven.com's discord
